# SuggestBot Wearable Text Entry System: Gaze Assisted Typing Interface

This is the main application for smart glasses and virtual reality head mount display

Specifically, it had been coded for FOVE VR0 device, but it can be run with any other devices powered by Unity.

However, if you use any other device, please re-set a keyboard layout dimension to consider a dimension of display on your device, and also must replace "Fove Rig" object in sample scene. 
The "Fove Rig" object is the render camera object, thus it must be replaced with any other render camera object for your device to use.
